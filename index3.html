    <p>As night falls on Hogsmeade village, “The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle” shines brightly with an
        awe-inspiring spectacle that showcases the four houses of Hogwarts: <span><b>Gryffindor</b></span> , Ravenclaw,

        Slytherin and culminates with awesome beams of lights that fan into the night sky.
        The colorful state-of-the-art light display and special effects projection is accompanied by a special musical
        arrangement created by Academy Award-winning composer <span><b>John Williams</b></span> based on his original
        scores composed for
        the film series. The musical arrangement that emanates in a surround sound environment was conducted by prolific
        arranger William Ross and recorded by the <span><b>London Symphony Orchestra</b></span> in London.
