<!-- Add a Document Title: Look at the URL

Add a Main Title: Look at the URL -->

<!-- Add an Horizontal Rule

Add a paragraph with the following text: We created our first form!! -->

<!-- Go to index.html

Input a username and password

Submit the form by clicking on the submit button

The browser will navigate to the login.html page -->

<!-- Take a look at the URL to see the data that you just input on the previous form -->

<!-- Now change the form method to be post instead of get and go over the last steps to input data, execute the form and look
at the URL again to see the difference between these two methods :) -->
